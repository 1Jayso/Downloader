# Project Title

Downloader --> A simple scraper to scrape video links from a site and download them

## Motivation
***I have this site where I normally download video tutorials. To download I have to copy the links into a 
downloader 1 by 1 to download the video files. The process was a little boring for me so I decided to automate the process 
with BeautifulSoup. It's not better than your downloader but it serves it purpose beautifully. Feel free 
to make it your own. That said, if you want to contribute to making it better then you are 
warmly welcome!***

### Ruuning the application
To test it:

Create a virtual environment using the following scripts:

```
python3 -m venv ["name of your Virtual Env"]
```

Install the the libraries used for this project by copying and pasting the below script in your terminal

```
pip install -r requirements.txt # This will install the libraries used for this project
```
Run the script by typing: ```python downloader.py```

Fanlly copy any of the links in the downloder.py file and paste it then enter the filetype of the video
