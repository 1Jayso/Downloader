# Project Title

Downloader --> A simple scraper to scrape video links from a site and download them

## Motivation
***I have this site where I normally download video tutorials. To download I have to copy the link into a 
downloader to download. The process was a little boring for me so I decided to try and automate the process 
with BeautifulSoup. It's not better than your downloader but it serves it purpose beautifully. Feel free 
to make it your own. That said, if you want to contribute to making it better then you are 
warmly welcome!***

### Ruuning the application

```

```
